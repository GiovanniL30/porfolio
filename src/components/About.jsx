              I am a passionate full stack web developer based in Baguio City, with a strong focus on building accessible and user-friendly
              applications. My skill set includes Node.js, ReactJS, Express, and MySQL, and I absolutely love programming. Iâ€™m always seeking to learn
              and grow, exploring new technologies and best practices. Outside of programming, I enjoy playing playing games and watching during my
              free time. I'm excited about solving real-world problems through code and continuously improving my skills.
